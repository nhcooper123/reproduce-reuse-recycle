Hi folks, I handling a very confusing paper. I'll share the workflow to explain why I'm confused

Data availability statement declares that data and code are available in Zenodo.
I checked the Zenodo and I successfully found  the code but not the data. So, no data (fine ?üëç  )
Then, I tried to open the R script - a file called ""eawp-data.R"". It didn't open.
then (plot twist)...I renamed ""eawp-data.R"" to ""eawp-data.Rdata"" and it is actually the data!

It took me a lot of time to figureout this workflow",Delete,Too many issues here to redo quickly,60

(2014) to the number of species used in each analysis using the package ape (Paradis, Claude, & Strimmer, 2004) in r (R Core Team, 2017).
We used parallel analysis to simulate 95th percentile eigenvalues from 100 simulated analyses and determine the number of retained principal components (Franklin, Gibson, Robertson, Pohlmann, & Fralish, 1995; Horn, 1965) using the function f a.parallel in the psych package (Revelle, 2017) in r (R Core Team, 2017).
To control for non-independence among lineages in our study, we conducted a phylogenetically informed PCA using the package phytools (Revell, 2012) in r (R Core Team, 2017).
For each PCA, we used the imputePCA function of the missMDA (Josse & Husson, 2016) package in r (R Core Team, 2017) to impute missing values. For the of 141 species, a total of 8.2% (116) of the 1,410 possible trait values were missing.
To examine whether a plant's mode of dispersal, growth form and matrix dimension (i.e. life cycle complexity) explain the location of a species along the major principal components, we used an ANOVA with Type 1 SS (Hector, Von Felten, & Schmid, 2010) including matrix dimension, dispersal mode, growth form and their two-way interactions as predictors (function aov in r, R Core Team, 2017).
To ensure our results were not affected by statistical dependence among the principal components, we conducted a permutational ANOVA on the first three principal components using Euclidian distance and 9,999 permutations with the function adonis in the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2017) in r (R Core Team, 2017).

Therefore, could you please take a look at it, if you can?
Also, they used two 'datasets': the Project Gutenburg Corpus which is a storing of many pieces of literature typed into the dataset, and a list of terms for species that they got from Wikispecies and Wikimedia. It seems that they only linked to Project Gutenburg, did not link to where they got their species list, and did not archive their filtered Gutenburg dataset or their filtered taxon term list. 
They also did not say how they actually filtered and analysed the datasets. The Project Gutenburg websites seem to say how to do so by code but they are not directly referenced.

I am not sure where I should have written this but as this is the last paper I will be able to analyse, I needed to give a word on how long it took me to analyse each paper:
It would take me a few hours for each paper. Papers that did archive their data, code and READMEs took the longest, compared to those that did not. 
What took longest was comparing the archived data to the methods as it involved meticulously reading the methods to ensure absolutely all the necessary data to reproduce the results were there. Evaluating the READMEs and annotations also took long, though not nearly as long.    
The amount of time I took is because I am unfortunately an outlier with ADHD, which makes reading anything, especially the thick complex texts of academic papers, quite difficult.",Edit,"The paper includes novel data compilation, resulting in a derived dataset which is not supplied, only links to the two original sources, so I have updated this to state that the data are not available",86
