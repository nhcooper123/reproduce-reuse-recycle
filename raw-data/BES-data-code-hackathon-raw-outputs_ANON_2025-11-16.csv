This model was constructed using the glmer function in the r package lme4 (Bates, Maechler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015). Fixed effects were Maritrema exposure level (control, low, medium and high) and presence/absence of a Philophthalmus colony in the snail. The interaction between exposure level and Philophthalmus colony presence/absence was removed during model construction based on model diagnostics and relative AIC values. Container number was also included as a random effect to control for potential differences among snail groups. p-values were calculated using the F-statistic and F-numerator generated by the GLMM described above and the F-denominator value from a general linear model (function glm in the r package stats) of the same structure as the GLMM, but without the random effect of tank number.

These were compared between populations using generalised linear models followed by Tukey's pairwise comparisons using function glht from the r package multcomp (Hothorn et al., 2008).
We tested for differences among functional groups of pollinators using analysis of variance and running paired Tukey tests in the base package in r.

We fitted GAM models using the mgcv package in r (Wood, 2011), and then calculated the statistical significance of selection coefficients via the bootstrap approach (N > 500 iterations) implemented in package gsg (Morrissey & Sakrejda, 2014).

STATEMENT ON INCLUSION

Our study failed to include local researchers and stakeholders. The Trinidad system has had many diverse research teams that, in the past, have successfully included local scientists and graduate students from the University of West Indies. However, time and funding were both limiting factors for this project. We realize that we could have made better efforts to reach out and include these scientists. We plan to mitigate this and reach out to local scientists for future projects.

We used modified binomial power analyses to assess our ability to detect P. destructans arrival at each site where no positive samples were detected. We first calculated an expected early prevalence at each site where P. destructans was not detected in early hibernation based on a weighted mean prevalence. The weighted mean prevalence was calculated as the average prevalence of each species at sites where P. destructans was detected in early hibernation multiplied by the proportional abundance of a given species at each site (Table S1). We then calculated the probability of missing P. destructans at a site as the probability of getting all negatives in bats given the expected prevalence at a site multiplied by the probability of missing P. destructans in the unsampled bats (calculation shown in Appendix S1).

We investigated the effect of timing of P. destructans arrival on late winter prevalence by fitting a GLMM with a binomial distribution and a logit link. We included fixed effects for the timing of P. destructans detection (early or late hibernation) interacting with the effect of species, and included site as a random effect. We also examined the effect of timing of P. destructans detection on fungal loads using a linear mixed model with species and timing of detection as interacting fixed effects, and site as a random effect. Lastly, we assessed the effect of the timing of P. destructans introduction on log10 bat population growth rates, calculated as the annual change in late winter counts at each site, using linear mixed models with species interacting with timing of detection as fixed effects and site as a random effect. We explored the inclusion of autumn prevalence as a continuous variable (0 for all sites and species where P. destructans was not detected, prevalence in each species ranged between 0 and 0.25 for sites where P. destructans was detected during autumn) and the results were qualitatively similar to those shown, so we present the discretization (early or late winter P. destructans detection) for simplicity of visualization and interpretation.

Lastly, we investigated evidence of overwinter movements of bats among sites. At each site, we calculated our response variable, overwinter urn:x-wiley:00218790:media:jane13439:jane13439-math-0001 as the proportional change in the number of bats of each species at a site by dividing the late hibernation count by the early hibernation count. We then used a linear mixed model to assess the relationship between log10(overwinter urn:x-wiley:00218790:media:jane13439:jane13439-math-0002) and log10(early hibernation colony size) with an additive or interactive effect of species and site as a random effect.",No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,106

Hi folks, I handling a very confusing paper. I'll share the workflow to explain why I'm confused

Data availability statement declares that data and code are available in Zenodo.
I checked the Zenodo and I successfully found  the code but not the data. So, no data (fine 👍  )
Then, I tried to open the R script - a file called ""eawp-data.R"". It didn't open.
then (plot twist)...I renamed ""eawp-data.R"" to ""eawp-data.Rdata"" and it is actually the data!

It took me a lot of time to figureout this workflow",2025-09-30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,60

These data are free to access, use and archive (conditions at INMET website). The climatic data used are made available on Figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4485503 (Louren¸co, 2019).
WorldClim V2 global data (Fick & Hijmans, 2017) were downloaded from a public repository online (https://www.worldclim.org/). Updated in July 2016, these data contain average monthly climatic measurements, representative of the period 1970–2000. The spatial resolution used for the maps of Brazil and South America was of 10 minutes (urn:x-wiley:2041210X:media:mee313205:mee313205-math-0047). The spatial resolution used for the maps of Honduras was 2.5 minutes (urn:x-wiley:2041210X:media:mee313205:mee313205-math-0048). These data are not made available in this manuscript due to license restrictions, but are publicly available at WorldClim webpage (https://www.worldclim.org/). See Supporting Information S2 Text for more details.
Dengue notification data (by clinical evaluation, not molecularly confirmed) were obtained from the Brazilian ministry of health, available at the TABNET webportal. These notification data included the total number of dengue cases per month, per year, over the period 2007–2012 for the main municipality of each city. The data used are made available on Figshare https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4485503 (Louren¸co, 2019).
Dengue and chikungunya incidence from Tegucigalpa (city) for the year 2015 were taken from the study by Zambrano et al. (2017) with permission from Elsevier (license number 4576391190534). Counts were collected by the national surveillance system and refer to cases clinically and laboratory confirmed (by serology and RT-PCR). Data series were extracted from Figure 5 using Engauge Digitizer Software V10.4 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2585387).

Taxonomic information was obtained from The Taxonomic Name Resolution Service using all available data sources (Boyle et al., 2013; The Taxonomic Name Resolution Service), including Tropicos (Missouri Botanical Garden), USDA (USDA, NRCS), Global Composite Checklist (Flann, 2009), The Plant List (2013), and International Legume Database and Information Service, and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group III (available from http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/).",No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Yes,"We obtained a phylogeny by trimming down the tree made available by Zanne et al. (2014) to the number of species used in each analysis using the package ape (Paradis, Claude, & Strimmer, 2004) in r (R Core Team, 2017).
We used parallel analysis to simulate 95th percentile eigenvalues from 100 simulated analyses and determine the number of retained principal components (Franklin, Gibson, Robertson, Pohlmann, & Fralish, 1995; Horn, 1965) using the function f a.parallel in the psych package (Revelle, 2017) in r (R Core Team, 2017).
To control for non-independence among lineages in our study, we conducted a phylogenetically informed PCA using the package phytools (Revell, 2012) in r (R Core Team, 2017).
For each PCA, we used the imputePCA function of the missMDA (Josse & Husson, 2016) package in r (R Core Team, 2017) to impute missing values. For the of 141 species, a total of 8.2% (116) of the 1,410 possible trait values were missing.
To examine whether a plant's mode of dispersal, growth form and matrix dimension (i.e. life cycle complexity) explain the location of a species along the major principal components, we used an ANOVA with Type 1 SS (Hector, Von Felten, & Schmid, 2010) including matrix dimension, dispersal mode, growth form and their two-way interactions as predictors (function aov in r, R Core Team, 2017).
To ensure our results were not affected by statistical dependence among the principal components, we conducted a permutational ANOVA on the first three principal components using Euclidian distance and 9,999 permutations with the function adonis in the package vegan (Oksanen et al., 2017) in r (R Core Team, 2017). As the results for the permutational ANOVA (Table S9) were the same as the results for the ANOVA, we report the results obtained from the ANOVA here.

Future versions of the package will include different methods and hierarchical models including the use of scaled TDFs (Hussey et al., 2014) and the estimation of consumer TP from amino acid δ15N (Bradley et al., 2015) that include variation in TDF and β. The development version is freely available in GitHub (https://github.com/clquezada/tRophicPosition), while the stable version (currently 0.7.5) can be found in CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=tRophicPosition).",No,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Yes,NA,Yes,Yes,NA,"yes, but only dev version on GitHub.

Also, they used two 'datasets': the Project Gutenburg Corpus which is a storing of many pieces of literature typed into the dataset, and a list of terms for species that they got from Wikispecies and Wikimedia. It seems that they only linked to Project Gutenburg, did not link to where they got their species list, and did not archive their filtered Gutenburg dataset or their filtered taxon term list. 
They also did not say how they actually filtered and analysed the datasets. The Project Gutenburg websites seem to say how to do so by code but they are not directly referenced.

I am not sure where I should have written this but as this is the last paper I will be able to analyse, I needed to give a word on how long it took me to analyse each paper:
It would take me a few hours for each paper. Papers that did archive their data, code and READMEs took the longest, compared to those that did not. 
What took longest was comparing the archived data to the methods as it involved meticulously reading the methods to ensure absolutely all the necessary data to reproduce the results were there. Evaluating the READMEs and annotations also took long, though not nearly as long.    
The amount of time I took is because I am unfortunately an outlier with ADHD, which makes reading anything, especially the thick complex texts of academic papers, quite difficult.",2025-11-03,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,86
