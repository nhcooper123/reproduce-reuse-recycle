# Initial data cleaning
# NC. Nov 2025

# Prior to running this code I ran a script that tidied and anonymised the recorders. 
# Each unique recorder or set of recorders has a unique recorder_ID number. recorder_ID 151 is NA.
# No other changes were made to the raw data.

# This script takes that raw data and (slowly and painfully) cleans it so it can be used in the analyses.

  # My choices here might be more controversial, sorry! 
  # I've combined all CC BY derivatives, e.g. CC BY-ND into one option: 'CC BY derivatives', as there are not many for each type.
  # Most specific licenses (e.g. GPL, MIT) have been changed to "Other". 
  # I've added OGL as an option as this came up a lot.
  # Many Zenodo based projects have license Other (open), but no other details of the license, so I classified this as "Other".
  # CC 4.0 == CC BY, this has been corrected.
  # Dryad uses CC0 (since 2009), so anyone using Dryad should have CC0 license selected.
  # Where multiple licenses are listed (rare) I have chosen the most restrictive.
  # Note for interpretation, I think some people confused code and data licenses here.
